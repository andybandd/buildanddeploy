Hi  I'm AndyB

I'm sorry I have very little to say. I'm an Accountant. Ha Ha !

I am hoping to fix that however. At a very old age, I've taken a fancy to coding, programming, crypto and all things IT.
I'm gonna try and make some money out of it before I shuffle off this mortal coil.

The plan is to get up to speed with HTML, CSS and Javascript. Then maybe some web frameworks React Django etc 
I would like to get some knowledge of databases too and so get a good overall grounding in front and Back end web development.
Should I get into Wordpress ? Ah Dunno !

I am assuming this will also get me familiar with python and php and some other languages and then I would like to learn Java.
Eventually perhaps I can get into smart contracts. 

I am very aware that the best way to get into this line of work is to do stuff i.e. projects apps etc rather than just watch tutoritals and read books 
so I'm gonna keep this front and center as I go forward.

As you can see its all pretty vague at the moment but here goes nothing. 

All the best
